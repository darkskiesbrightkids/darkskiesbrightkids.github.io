This is a running list of edits/changes to make to the DSBK website. These may be either from the devs or from members of the organization and changes they would like to see implemented.

As you complete tasks, please remove them from this document!

- possibly change "DSBK" text (center of header/nav bar) to the current DSBK logo (same as profile picture on Github)
